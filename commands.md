##  Vault Core CLI Commands

###  Initialization & Unseal

```bash
vault operator init                            # Initialize Vault
vault operator unseal                          # Manually unseal Vault using unseal key

##  Authentication & Tokens

###  Login / Logout

```bash
vault login                                    # Login to Vault

vault auth enable <method>                     # Enable auth method (e.g., userpass, ldap, github)
vault auth disable <path>                      # Disable auth method
vault write auth/userpass/users/<user> ...     # Create userpass user
vault read auth/userpass/users/<user>          # View user info

##  Example Vault CLI Usage Flow

vault kv put secret/myapp password=hunter2

# Read secret
vault kv get secret/myapp

# Create policy
vault policy write mypolicy ./mypolicy.hcl

# Enable userpass
vault auth enable userpass

# Add user
vault write auth/userpass/users/jane password=janepass policies=mypolicy

# Login as user
vault login -method=userpass username=jane password=janepass
```

##  `vault operator init` â€” **Initialization of Real Vault Instance**

###  Purpose:

This command is used to **initialize a real Vault deployment** (non-dev mode). It sets up the master key, generates unseal keys, and prepares Vault for production use.

###  What it does:

* Generates a **master key**.
* Splits the master key into **unseal key shards** using **Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing**.
* Creates the initial **root token**.
* Stores an **encrypted DEK (data encryption key)** in the storage backend (like Consul, S3, etc).
* Prepares Vault to be unsealed using `vault operator unseal`.

###  Usage:

```bash
vault operator init -key-shares=5 -key-threshold=3
```

###  When to use:

* When you run Vault in **server mode** (`vault server -config=config.hcl`).
* **Only run once** per Vault deployment. Initialization is a **one-time operation**.

---

## ðŸ”¸ `vault server -dev` â€” **Development/Test Mode**

###  Purpose:

Starts Vault in **development mode** for quick testing and learning. Itâ€™s not secure and should **never be used in production**.

###  What it does:

* **Skips `vault operator init`** â€” Vault auto-initializes itself.
* Uses a **single in-memory unseal key** and **auto-unseals** itself.
* Generates a **root token automatically**.
* Stores everything **in-memory** â€” all data is wiped on restart.
* Default settings are insecure (e.g., no TLS, root access exposed).

###  Usage:

```bash
vault server -dev
```

###  When to use:

* For **local development**, **learning**, or **trying out commands**.
* When you **donâ€™t want to deal with unseal/init/config complexity**.
